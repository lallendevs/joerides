    <p class="story-kicker">From Sandy, his wife</p>

    <div class="story-body">
      <p>Joe was only 59, and none of us were ready to lose him. He passed away peacefully in his sleep — and while that may have been gentle for him, it was a shock to all of us who loved him so deeply.</p>

      <p>Joe was truly one of a kind. He was so damn funny...he had a sense of humor like no one else — quick, clever, and perfectly timed. He made everybody laugh. And this was just one of the things that made him so very special. He loved being the funny guy and the center of attention that way but on the other hand in some ways was so private...and absolutely so humble about his contribution to our country through the US Coast Guard and to the Commonwealth through the Massachusetts State Police.</p>

      <p>Joe lived a life of service and purpose. He was dedicated, he was patriotic, and he loved this country and the American flag. And that wasn’t just something he said — it was something he lived. He believed in doing the right thing, in standing up for others, and in being a man of integrity.</p>

      <p>Joe earned a deep respect from those who worked alongside him. I loved hearing stories from those who worked with him and those he coached — but like I said in true Joe fashion, he was humble to his core. He never tooted his own horn — in fact, he was all about flying under the radar. So it fills my heart to hear so many people singing his praises now over this past week, because he deserves every single word.</p>

      <p>Joe was like everybody’s big brother — always ready with advice, a listening ear, or a steady hand. And yes, most times, that person needing advice was me. I can't tell you how many ledges he talked me off of. He was my biggest supporter... my rock...my biggest cheerleader. He always believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself. I'm a better person because Joe was in my life. Joe taught me it doesn't make a damn what other people think of you...it only matters what you think of yourself.</p>

      <p>He was my best friend and I don't know how I'm going to do life without him.</p>

      <p>Joe lived a full life. WE lived a full life. And yes...how could I not mention Harley. Anyone who knew him knew motorcycles were his passion, his freedom, and his joy. And like our friends and I reflected this weekend we had more adventures and experiences on the bike over the past decade or so than alot of people have in a lifetime.</p>

      <p>But as we also said...we still had so so much more we wanted to do.</p>

      <p>There’s a hole in my heart that can never be filled, but there’s also gratitude — gratitude for the years, the adventures, and the love we shared.</p>

      <p>Joe, thank you for being my person, my protector, my best friend, and my home. I’ll love you forever, and I’ll carry your spirit with me on every road ahead.</p>

      <p>I love you so much hon. And I always will.</p>
